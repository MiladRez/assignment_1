# Your solution to E26

Provide a table of what you think will be the advantages and
disadvantages of designs 2, 3 and 6.

To do this evaluation (of E26, E28-E30), for each design create random instances and
then call each method many thousands of times, and then find the elapsed time in milliseconds
for the fixed number of iterations. Make sure that your program runs each time for about
10 seconds, so you get a good measure of performance. Test each method separately.
Run each version several times to ensure that your results are consistent and use
the median result as your definitive result, plus give the maximum and minimum.

| Design | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Design 2: Store polar coordinates only | Quicker when only working with polar coordinates | Slower to return cartesian coordinates as a conversion occurs every time it is requested, Slower to initialize when cartesian parameters are passed as a conversion is made to instantiate variables|
| Design 3: Store cartesian coordinates only | Quicker when only working with cartesian coordinates| Slower to compute cartesian coordinates as a conversion occurs every time it is requested, Slower to initialize when cartesian parameters are passed as a conversion is made to instantiate variables|
| Design 6: Interface with designs 2 and 3 as classes implementing it. | Allows for common structure between both Design 2 and Design 3 | Allows for common structure between both Design 2 and Design 3, Is rigid and does not allow for flexibility such as adding/removing methods in only one of designs 2/3|
